import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Schedule

The schedule below is broken into the three `3` major units which structure the class. This should be considered
a _living document_, meaning that changes will likely occur. In the event of a change, you will be notified at least
24 hours before the change takes effect. A due date will _never_ be moved forward using this rule.

### Schedule Legend

<ul class = "icon-legend">
    <li><Icon name = "information" />Weekly theme</li>
    <li><Icon name = "open-book" />Relevent reading(s) for the week</li>
    <li><Icon name = "approve-check" />Benchmark of the week</li>
    <li><Icon name = "seti:notebook" />Link to weekly slides</li>
    <li><Icon name = "puzzle" />Lab session indicator</li>
</ul>

## Units

<CourseSchedule content={frontmatter.units} />
